# Maximizing Revenue for Taxi Cab Drivers through Payment Type Analysis

# Problem Statement
In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, making the most of revenue is essential for long-term success and driver happiness. 
Our goal is to use data-driven insights to maximise revenue streams for taxi drivers in order to meet this need. Our research 
aims to determine whether payment methods have an impact on fare pricing by focusing on the relationship between payment type
and fare amount.

# Objective
This project main goal is to run A/B test to examine the relationship between the total fare and the method of payment.
We use Python hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics to extract useful information that can help taxi drivers generate 
more cash.in particular, we want to find out if there is big difference in the fares for those who pay with credit card vs
those who pay with cash.
